# **Python Challenge - PyBank & PyPoll**

## **Overview**

This challenge includes two Python tasks: **PyBank** and **PyPoll**. Both tasks are designed to help you practice your Python scripting skills by solving real-world problems involving financial analysis and vote-counting automation.

- **PyBank**: Analyze a companyâ€™s financial records to compute various financial metrics.
- **PyPoll**: Analyze a set of election data to determine the total votes, the distribution of votes among candidates, and the winner.

---

## **Challenge Structure**

The challenge is organized into two main folders, one for each task:

- **PyBank**: Folder containing the Python script and resources for the financial analysis.
- **PyPoll**: Folder containing the Python script and resources for the election data analysis.

Each folder should have the following structure:
- `main.py`: The Python script that performs the analysis.
- `Resources/`: A folder containing the dataset CSV files used for the analysis.
- `Analysis/`: A folder containing the output text file with the results.

---

## **How to Use**

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   Clone the repository to your local machine using:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/python-challenge.git


2. **Navigate to the Appropriate Folder**

    To navigate to the folder of the challenge you want to run (either **PyBank** or **PyPoll**), use the following commands:

    ```bash
    cd python-challenge/PyBank
    ```

    or

    ```bash
    cd python-challenge/PyPoll
    ```

3. **Run the Python Script**

    Make sure Python is installed on your machine. To run the Python script, use the following command:

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

3. **View the Results**

    The script will print the analysis to the terminal and generate a text file in the `Analysis/` folder containing the same results.

## PyBank - Financial Analysis

In this challenge, you are tasked with analyzing a financial dataset (`budget_data.csv`). The dataset contains two columns: **Date** and **Profit/Losses**.

### Objectives

Your goal is to create a Python script that calculates the following:

- The total number of months included in the dataset.
- The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period.
- The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, along with the average of those changes.
- The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.
- The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.

### Result

   ```plaintext
   Financial Analysis
   ----------------------------
   Total Months: 86
   Total: $22564198
   Average Change: $-8311.11
   Greatest Increase in Profits: Aug-16 ($1862002)
   Greatest Decrease in Profits: Feb-14 ($-1825558)
```


## PyPoll - Election Analysis

In this challenge, you are tasked with analyzing election data (election_data.csv). The dataset contains three columns: Voter ID, County, and Candidate.

### Objectives
Your goal is to calculate the following:

The total number of votes cast.
A complete list of candidates who received votes.
The percentage of votes each candidate won.
The total number of votes each candidate won.
The winner of the election based on the popular vote.
### Result
```plaintext
Election Results
-------------------------
Total Votes: 369711
-------------------------
Charles Casper Stockham: 23.049% (85213)
Diana DeGette: 73.812% (272892)
Raymon Anthony Doane: 3.139% (11606)
-------------------------
Winner: Diana DeGette
